// Standalone lesson: telling time and time-of-day words in Hmong.
// Content filled 2026-07-16 (Slice A pass) — audio still pending, see
// instructions/audio-files.md. Follows the lesson model in ../lessons.js.

// Exported as `timeExplained`, NOT `time` — time.js already exports `time`, and
// two modules exporting the same name collide the moment lessons.js imports
// both. Step ids below are likewise prefixed `time-explained-`: ids are
// progress keys, so reusing `numbers-time-*` would have made finishing a step
// here mark the same step complete in the other lesson.

        '"Thiab" means "and". The moment you use it, the word "feeb" ("minute") becomes required — you are no longer reading a clock face, you are counting two quantities.',
