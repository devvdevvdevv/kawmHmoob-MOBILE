// Standalone lesson: how a Hmong word is built.
// This is the ANCHOR lesson of Foundations — the one idea every other alphabet
// unit (Consonants / Vowels / Tones) hangs off. Teach the formula first, then
// send the learner to each piece.
//
// PLACEHOLDER SCAFFOLD — prose is real but wants a native-speaker pass.
